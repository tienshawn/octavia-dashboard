    horizon openstack_dashboard/conf/ directory and also

    RBAC can now be enabled for the Octavia dashboard. Whether you enable RBAC
    in the dashboard or not, the API RBAC will still be in effect. Enabling
    RBAC in the dashboard will enforce the policies in the dashboard before
    the API call is made.
