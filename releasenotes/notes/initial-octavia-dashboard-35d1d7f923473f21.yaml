    The Octavia team is excited to release the 1.0.0 version of the Octavia
    dashboard. This dashboard uses the Octavia API endpoint via the
    openstacksdk. This release includes a number of improvements over the
    old neutron-lbaas-dashboard that worked against the neutron API endpoint.
    These improvements are listed below in the features section of this
    release note.
features:
  - |
    The object details pages now use a tabbed navigation for child objects.
  - |
    Provisioning and operating status is now available on all object details
    pages.
  - |
    Pools can now change the load balancing algorithm after creation.
  - |
    Members now display the subnet_id on the details page.
  - |
    Health monitors can now change the expected HTTP codes.
  - |
    The session persistence for a pool can now be changed.
  - |
    Created at and Updated at times are now visible on the details pages.
  - |
    Health monitors can now use alternate IP addresses and ports.
  - |
    Listener connection limits can now be updated.
  - |
    All objects now allow setting the "Admin State".
issues:
  - |
    The octavia-dashboard requires openstacksdk >= 0.10.0 to resolve an issue
    with displaying the health monitor details page. It is expected this will
    be included in the OpenStack Queens release.
upgrade:
  - |
    This dashboard can be used alongside the neutron-lbaas-dashboard, but both
    dashboard panels will use the "Load Balancer" labels.
other:
  - |
    The neutron-lbaas neutron extension is not required to use this dashboard.
    Load balancers created with neutron-lbaas that have not been migrated to
    Octavia may not be accessible via this dashboard. Only resources
    accessible via the Octavia API will be visible in this dashboard.
