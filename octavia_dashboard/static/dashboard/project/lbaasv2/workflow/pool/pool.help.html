<p translate>
  A pool represents a group of members over which the load balancing will be applied.
</p>
<p>
  <strong translate>Algorithm:</strong>
  <translate>
  The load balancer algorithm that distributes traffic to the pool members.
  </translate>
  <ul>
    <li translate>
      LEAST_CONNECTIONS: Allocates requests to the instance with the least number of active
      connections.
    </li>
    <li translate>
      ROUND_ROBIN: Rotates requests evenly between multiple instances.
    </li>
    <li translate>
      SOURCE_IP: Requests from a unique source IP address are consistently directed to the same instance.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong translate>Protocol:</strong>
  <translate>
  The protocol for which this pool and its members listen. A valid value is HTTP, HTTPS, PROXY, PROXYV2, TCP, UDP or SCTP.
  </translate>
</p>
<p>
  <strong translate>Session Persistence:</strong>
  <translate>
  The type of session persistence for distributing traffic to the pool members.
  </translate>
  <ul>
    <li translate>
      SOURCE_IP: Session persistence based on source ip.
    </li>
    <li translate>
      HTTP_COOKIE: Session persistence based on http cookie.
    </li>
    <li translate>
      APP_COOKIE: Session persistence based on application cookie.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong translate>TLS Enabled:</strong>
  <translate>
  Enable TLS for backend re-encryption, communications between the load
  balancer and the member servers are encrypted.
  </translate>
</p>
<p>
  <strong translate>TLS Cipher String:</strong>
  <translate>
  A string of the allowed ciphers using the OpenSSL syntax. The syntax
  is a colon separated list of the chiphers, ex.
  "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
  Note, don't include quotation marks. An empty string sets the default TLS
  Cipher String configured in Octavia.
